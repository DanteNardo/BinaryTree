# BinaryTree
An example of a binary tree of integers with custom left and right values based off of the parent and its neighbors. The left value is equal to the parent's value plus the parent's left neighbor value if it exists. The right value is equal to the parent's value plus the parent's right neighbor value if it exists. The program takes a custom depth input and then prints the tree to the screen.
